The task is given below and completed in the task.py file:

Write a program (in any language of your choice) with the following behaviour, but written with as many bad coding practices possible. Annotate the code with comments that explain what the bad practices are, and why they should be avoided.

Iterate through numbers from 1 to 100;

- If the number is divisible by 3, print "Comp"
- If the number is divisible by 5, print "Club"
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "CompClub"
- Otherwise, just print the number

You may recognise this as the "FizzBuzz" problem.
